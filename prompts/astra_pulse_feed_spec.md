# ⚡ ASTRA Pulse Feed Specification
**Project:** ASTRA – Awareness, Security & Threat Response Assistant  
**Component:** ASTRA Pulse (Dynamic Insight Feed)  
**Purpose:** Define the concept, structure, and behaviour of ASTRA Pulse — the live, adaptive feed that delivers daily insights, prompts, and reflections to sustain engagement and continuous learning.

---

## 🌐 Concept Overview
**ASTRA Pulse** is the heartbeat of the platform — a dynamic content stream that blends education, inspiration, and discovery. It surfaces the most relevant insights from ILM reflections, community prompts, and system analytics to create a personalised daily learning experience.

> **Tagline:** “One pulse at a time — stay aware, stay inspired.”

Pulse acts as a **context-aware feed**, curated by AstraCore, that evolves with each user’s learning journey.

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. **Engage** users between sessions through meaningful content.  
2. **Reinforce** learning through short, reflective, and shareable insights.  
3. **Bridge** individual progress with community inspiration.  
4. **Encourage** reflection and reuse of ILM, modules, and prompt templates.

## 🧠 1. Content Categories
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Daily Prompt Challenge** | A short, scenario-driven task users can complete in minutes. | “Write a 100-word awareness email using COAST and empathy tone.” |
| **Insight Drop** | One-line or paragraph reflections drawn from mentor data. | “Clarity is empathy in disguise. Define your audience, and your message sharpens.” |
| **Learning Highlight** | Extracted snippet from ILM reflections or modules. | “Your Governance layer showed strong attention to transparency — a key ISO principle.” |
| **Community Spark** | (Optional future) Curated prompts from other users. | “Top prompt of the week: Leadership Layer Challenge.” |
| **Resource Link** | Curated article or AI-related insight (NIST, EU AI Act, or security event). | “AI Act 2026: new compliance deadlines — read summary →” |
| **Mentor Quote** | Generated by AstraCore to reinforce motivation. | “You don’t find insight — you grow into it.” |

## ⚙️ 2. Functional Behaviour
### A. Feed Dynamics
- Displays 5–7 curated items daily (refreshes every 24 hours).  
- Items tagged by skill focus: *Clarity, Empathy, Governance, Creativity, Reflection.*  
- Uses previous ILM data to weight content (e.g., if user focuses on Security, prioritise Governance items).

### B. User Interaction
- Each item is **actionable** — users can click:
  - “Try Prompt” → opens mini builder.
  - “Save Reflection” → adds note to Reflection Deck.
  - “Mark Complete” → updates Progress Tracker.
- Swipe or scroll to navigate through the day’s feed.

### C. Adaptive Personalisation
- AstraCore curates feed using stored user metadata:
  - Preferred frameworks, recent ILM layers, top skills.  
  - Completed modules or current learning streak.  
  - Time since last login (freshness weighting).
- Feeds are unique per user — but maintain a consistent visual rhythm.

## 🧩 3. Pulse Structure
### Data Schema (Conceptual)
```json
{
  "pulse_id": "uuid",
  "date": "2025-11-01",
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "daily_challenge",
      "title": "The 100-Word Challenge",
      "content": "Write a concise phishing alert using empathy and precision.",
      "action": "try_prompt",
      "tags": ["Clarity", "Empathy"],
      "source": "ASTRA ILM Module 2"
    },
    {
      "type": "insight_drop",
      "content": "Each layer you complete isn’t progress — it’s transformation.",
      "tags": ["Reflection"],
      "source": "AstraCore Mentor"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content Sources
- Internal: ILM reflections, mentor insights, completed modules.  
- External: RSS or API from trusted sources (NIST, ENISA, HBR, MIT Tech Review).  
- Manual: Admin-created “Feature of the Week” items.

### Curation Flow
```
User Progress → AstraCore Analytics → Pulse Generator → Feed Display → Reflection/Action → Progress Update
```

| **Visual Design** | Subtle pulse animation, gradient glow on new items. |
| **Action Buttons** | Try, Save, Reflect, Share. |
| **Mentor Overlay** | AstraCore avatar comments on key items (“This challenge suits your Leadership focus.”). |
| **Sound Cue** | Soft pulse tone when new feed available. |
| **Archive Mode** | Access past Pulse days via calendar or streak timeline. |

---

## 📈 5. Integration Points
| Component | Interaction |
|------------|--------------|
| **AstraCore (Mentor)** | Curates, comments, and nudges based on Pulse items. |
| **Reflection Deck** | Captures insights from Pulse reflections. |
| **Progress Tracker** | Logs completed Pulse challenges and updates metrics. |
| **ILM Modules** | Links back to relevant content for reinforcement. |
| **Community Feed (Future)** | Surfaces anonymised trending prompts. |

---

## 🧠 6. Engagement Logic
### Frequency & Timing
- Daily refresh at local midnight.
- Optional push/email notification: “Your new ASTRA Pulse is ready.”

### Reward Hooks
- Completing a Pulse challenge yields:  
  - +1 Reflection Card  
  - Micro-insight summary  
  - Optional badge progress (e.g., *Insight Voyager*)

### Personal Growth Reinforcement
- “Since last week, your clarity prompts improved by 22%. Keep layering precision.”
- “Three reflections this week — your learning streak is alive.”

## 🔮 7. Future Evolution
1. **Community Mode:** allow curated sharing of Pulse creations.  
2. **Collaborative Challenges:** group prompts for teams or leadership squads.  
3. **Thematic Weeks:** rotating focus (Leadership, Security, Ethics, Creativity).  
4. **Pulse Archive Search:** find old challenges by tag or date.  
5. **AI Summary Digest:** weekly recap of learning and growth highlights.

## ✅ 8. Next Steps
1. Design Pulse card layout and animation in UI.  
2. Define JSON schema and API endpoints.  
3. Prototype personalised content generation using AstraCore context.  
4. Connect Pulse activity to Reflection Tracker and Progress dashboard.  
5. Draft 10 sample Pulse items (5 internal, 5 external-style).
