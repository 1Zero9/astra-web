# 📘 ASTRA ILM Micro-Learning Modules
**Project:** ASTRA – Awareness, Security & Threat Response Assistant  
**Component:** Inception Learning Model (ILM)  
**Purpose:** Define the first four modular learning experiences under Phase 2 – EDUCATE.

---

## 🎯 Overview
Each ILM Micro-Learning Module teaches through *layered experience*. Learners progress from context to reflection, reinforcing knowledge with practice. Every module outputs a tangible artefact: a prompt, a simulation, a leadership plan, or an awareness pack.

All modules follow the **ILM Layered Pattern**:

| Layer | Focus | Example Output |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| L0 – Spark | Hook & Objective | Intro narrative, learning aim |
| L1 – Frame | Context & Constraints | Scenario setup, tone, limitations |
| L2 – Roleplay | Perspective & Stakeholders | Role definition, personas |
| L3 – Simulation | Actions & Decisions | Step-by-step practice exercise |
| L4 – Reflection | Debrief & Transfer | Insight cards, metrics, lessons learned |
| L5 – Synthesis | Mega Prompt | Export-ready prompt or content pack |

Each module can be completed independently or linked in a progressive “learning path”.

## 🧩 Module 1 – Prompt Engineering Foundations
**Theme:** Learn to think like an AI collaborator.

### Objective
Build a strong foundation in prompt design by exploring clarity, role, and structure through the CLEAR and RISEN frameworks.

### Structure
- **L0 Spark:** *What makes a good prompt?* Short intro with examples of weak vs strong prompts.
- **L1 Frame:** Context setup for a general AI task (e.g., summarising, writing, analysing).
- **L2 Roleplay:** Assign the AI a role and define expectations.
- **L3 Simulation:** Refine a poor prompt into a strong one using step-by-step comparison.
- **L4 Reflection:** Reflection card shows measurable improvement (“precision +40%”).
- **L5 Synthesis:** Generates a polished reusable template.

### Output
A reusable personal prompt template library (.md or .txt) with examples and notes.

## 🧠 Module 2 – AI for Security Awareness
**Theme:** Apply AI prompting to create real-world awareness materials.

### Objective
Guide users to create an end-to-end phishing simulation using ILM layering and COAST.

### Structure
- **L0 Spark:** Introduce a believable “phishing incident” scenario.
- **L1 Frame:** Context (department, risk level, constraints – EASY/MED/HARD per NIST scale).
- **L2 Roleplay:** Assign AI as “Security Awareness Coach.”
- **L3 Simulation:** Design the email, micro-quiz, and follow-up message.
- **L4 Reflection:** Learners evaluate clarity, ethical boundaries, and effectiveness.
- **L5 Synthesis:** Compose a complete awareness pack (email + quiz + reflection questions) with credits.

### Output
An exportable “Phishing Simulation Kit” with embedded educational commentary.

## 💼 Module 3 – AI for Leadership
**Theme:** Lead with clarity and empathy in an AI-augmented environment.

### Objective
Use the ILM + Leadership Track (Intent / Lens / Mindset / Method / Measure) to build leadership communication and strategy prompts.

### Structure
- **L0 Spark:** The challenge of leading hybrid AI-human teams.
- **L1 Frame:** Context (organisation, culture, goal).
- **L2 Roleplay:** Define AI as advisor, strategist, or coach.
- **L3 Simulation:** Create a 3-month leadership roadmap.
- **L4 Reflection:** Evaluate tone, inclusivity, and outcome alignment.
- **L5 Synthesis:** Export a leadership strategy prompt with credit to Geoff Woods.

### Output
A shareable “AI Leadership Plan” template, blending strategy and empathy.

---

## ⚖️ Module 4 – Governance & Ethics
**Theme:** Ensure safe, compliant, and ethical AI use.

### Objective
Educate users to include governance checks, bias prevention, and attribution within every prompt.

### Structure
- **L0 Spark:** Hook: “What happens when prompts go unchecked?”
- **L1 Frame:** Define ethical risks and data sensitivity boundaries.
- **L2 Roleplay:** AI acts as Compliance Officer.
- **L3 Simulation:** Build a prompt review checklist and apply it to a test case.
- **L4 Reflection:** Record insights: transparency, explainability, risk trade-offs.
- **L5 Synthesis:** Output an “AI Governance Prompt Framework.”

### Output
A governance-ready prompt checklist with example language and auto-inserted credit lines.

---

## 🔄 Optional Extensions
- **ASTRA Pulse Integration:** Daily micro-lessons from these modules as mini challenges.
- **Archetype Alignment:** Link each module to one Archetype (Explorer → Module 1, Coach → Module 2, Visionary → Module 3, Architect → Module 4).
- **Certification Path:** Completing all four unlocks an “AI Awareness Practitioner” digital badge.

---

## ✅ Next Steps
1. Draft ILM layer templates in the builder for each module.
2. Add Reflection Card generator logic.
3. Develop export templates (MD/JSON) for prompt outputs.
4. Build badge design and lightweight progress tracker.
