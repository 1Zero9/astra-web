# ⚖️ ASTRA AI Ethics & Governance Filter Specification
**Project:** ASTRA – Awareness, Security & Threat Response Assistant  
**Component:** AI Ethics & Governance Filter (AEGF)  
**Purpose:** Define the design, scope, and function of ASTRA’s automated ethical and governance compliance layer — ensuring that all generated and shared content aligns with organisational, legal, and ethical standards.

---

## 🌐 Concept Overview
The **AI Ethics & Governance Filter (AEGF)** acts as ASTRA’s internal conscience — a multi-stage evaluation engine that analyses prompts, outputs, and shared materials for **compliance, bias, accuracy, and data protection** before publication or export.

> **Tagline:** “Every insight accountable. Every prompt responsible.”

AEGF runs silently in the background, providing transparent feedback when ethical or governance risks are detected.

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. Prevent accidental or unethical use of sensitive data.  
2. Promote responsible AI education and communication.  
3. Align all ASTRA content with security, compliance, and governance frameworks.  
4. Reinforce trust and integrity across community interactions.

## 🧠 1. Filter Layers
| Layer | Function | Description |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **L1 – Content Safety** | Screening | Detects disallowed, harmful, or sensitive data (e.g., PII, credentials). |
| **L2 – Bias & Fairness** | Analysis | Flags language containing stereotypes, bias, or exclusivity. |
| **L3 – Governance & Compliance** | Validation | Checks for regulatory, legal, or confidentiality breaches (GDPR, ISO, EU AI Act). |
| **L4 – Ethical Context** | Interpretation | Evaluates tone, intent, and ethical implications in context. |
| **L5 – Attribution & Transparency** | Enforcement | Confirms proper citations, author credits, and framework sourcing. |

Each layer operates independently and sequentially — outputs must pass all five to proceed to publication or sharing.

## ⚙️ 2. Functional Flow
```
User Submission → AEGF Analysis Pipeline → Risk Scoring → Feedback → Approve/Block/Review → Output/Publish
```

### A. Risk Scoring Model
| Score | Category | Action |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **0–20** | Safe | Auto-approve. |
| **21–50** | Moderate | Flag for user review; suggestions provided. |
| **51–80** | High | Requires moderator approval. |
| **81–100** | Critical | Auto-block; reason and recovery advice displayed. |

---

## 🔍 3. Key Detection Areas
| Category | Examples | Action |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **PII Leakage** | Names, emails, phone numbers, financial data. | Auto-block. |
| **Sensitive Scenarios** | Political, religious, or discriminatory content. | Flag + educate user. |
| **Compliance Breach** | GDPR, ISO, or corporate IP. | Manual moderator review. |
| **Bias Indicators** | Gendered terms, stereotypes, cultural insensitivity. | Suggest neutral alternatives. |
| **Misinformation** | Outdated or unverifiable facts. | Link to correct resources. |
| **Missing Credit** | Framework or source not cited. | Auto-add credit line. |

---

## 🧩 4. Integration Points
| Component | Interaction |
|------------|--------------|
| **Prompt Builder / ILM** | Runs background checks as user types. Highlights issues inline. |
| **Reflection Deck** | Flags reflections that need governance clarification. |
| **Community Sharing** | Mandatory pre-publication scan (L1–L5). |
| **Pulse Feed** | Filters external and community-sourced content before publication. |
| **AstraCore (Mentor)** | Provides educational explanations and recommendations. |

Example:  
> *AstraCore:* “This prompt mentions an identifiable organisation. For compliance, anonymise details or generalise the example.”

---

## 📘 5. Governance Standards Alignment
AEGF is modelled on key frameworks:
- **ISO 27001 / 27701** – Information & Privacy Management.
- **ISO 42001** – AI Management System.
- **EU AI Act (2026)** – Risk classification and transparency.
- **NIST AI RMF** – Trustworthy AI principles.
- **Ethical AI Guidelines (OECD, ENISA, UK ICO)**.

> Each output includes a metadata tag referencing these standards for auditability.

---

## 💬 6. User Experience Design
| Scenario | User Experience |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Low Risk (Green)** | Subtle success checkmark. “Compliant & ready.” |
| **Medium Risk (Amber)** | Inline message with hover tooltip: “Consider removing sensitive reference.” |
| **High Risk (Red)** | Modal with detailed feedback and learning links. |
| **Critical Risk (Blocked)** | Prompt replaced with warning card explaining why. |

### Example UX Copy
> “Your reflection mentions employee data. ASTRA hides sensitive details automatically. Learn more about responsible AI communication.”

Tone = supportive, educational, never punitive.

## 🧮 7. Technical Design (Conceptual)
### Schema
```json
{
  "submission_id": "uuid",
  "content": "string",
  "score": 42,
  "risk_category": "Moderate",
  "flags": ["Bias: gendered phrasing", "Missing credit: ILM"],
  "suggestions": ["Use gender-neutral pronouns", "Add source attribution"],
  "resolved": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-01T17:30:00Z"
}
```

### Engine Components
- **Classifier** – Keyword and NLP-based screening.  
- **Contextual Evaluator** – Semantic analysis for tone and implication.  
- **Compliance Mapper** – Framework keyword matching (ISO/NIST/AI Act).  
- **Feedback Generator** – Plain-English explanation + fix suggestions.  
- **Audit Logger** – Records every scan for governance reporting.

---

## 🧠 8. Learning & Awareness Integration
AEGF is not just a filter — it teaches.  
- When issues are flagged, users receive short educational blurbs (“Governance insight cards”).  
- These are saved to the Reflection Deck under a new category: *Ethical Awareness.*  
- Repeat errors trigger mentor lessons or micro-modules.  

> Example: “Repeated GDPR mentions detected — would you like a 3-minute refresher on Data Minimisation?”

---

## 🔮 9. Future Evolution
1. **Adaptive Scoring:** dynamically adjusts tolerance based on user skill level.  
2. **Multi-Language Support:** expands beyond English.  
3. **Model Explainability Reports:** summaries of why content was flagged.  
4. **Audit Export Tool:** PDF summary for CE+ / ISO audits.  
5. **Federated Governance Integration:** sync compliance rules from enterprise policy APIs.  

---

## ✅ 10. Next Steps
1. Prototype core rule engine (basic regex + AI tone model).  
2. Develop feedback UI states (Green/Amber/Red/Critical).  
3. Connect to ILM and Community Sharing workflows.  
4. Design educational Insight Cards.  
5. Align content taxonomy with ISO/NIST keywords.
