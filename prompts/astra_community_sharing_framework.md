# 🌍 ASTRA Community & Sharing Framework
**Project:** ASTRA – Awareness, Security & Threat Response Assistant  
**Component:** ASTRA Community & Sharing Layer  
**Purpose:** Define how ASTRA enables ethical, creative, and secure sharing of prompts, insights, and learning artefacts between users — extending the Pulse Feed, ILM, and Reflection systems into a collaborative ecosystem.

---

## 🌟 Concept Overview
The **ASTRA Community Framework** connects individual learning journeys into a shared, moderated space where users can:
- Exchange prompts and ideas ethically.  
- Learn from others’ approaches and creativity.  
- Contribute to collective awareness on security, leadership, and AI literacy.  

It is not a social media feed — it’s a **curated knowledge exchange**, grounded in governance, respect, and purpose.

> **Tagline:** “Collaborate. Reflect. Grow together.”

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. **Empower** users to publish and remix prompts safely.  
2. **Build** a positive community of learning, awareness, and reflection.  
3. **Encourage** ethical behaviour through transparent credit and moderation.  
4. **Sustain** engagement by showcasing real creativity and success stories.

## 🧠 1. Community Components
| Component | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Hall of Prompts** | Curated showcase of outstanding ILM or Pulse creations. | “Top Governance Prompt of the Month.” |
| **Prompt Remix Hub** | Users can remix shared prompts (copy, modify, cite). | “Adapted from Sarah M.’s Reflection Layer 3.” |
| **Reflection Exchange** | Optional sharing of Reflection Cards as anonymised insights. | “Someone learned: empathy improves compliance clarity.” |
| **Challenge Arena** | Periodic themed events (e.g., Leadership Week, Security Sprint). | “Design an ethical AI policy prompt under 150 words.” |
| **Mentor Commentary** | AstraCore highlights notable prompts or insights. | “This leadership prompt models excellent tone clarity.” |
| **Feedback Thread** | Structured peer review via prompt evaluation form. | Rate on: clarity, creativity, governance. |

## ⚙️ 2. Ethical Framework
ASTRA’s community layer is **governance-first** — built on trust and transparency.

### A. Attribution & Credit
- All shared content automatically includes:
  > *“Created in ASTRA using [Framework] and ILM.”*  
  > *Credit: [Author Name or Alias]. Licensed under ASTRA Creative Commons.*

### B. Moderation Principles
- **Curation, not policing:** focus on quality, not quantity.  
- **AI Ethics Filter:** pre-checks shared prompts for compliance, bias, or sensitive data.  
- **Human Oversight:** curated by internal moderators or trusted community guides.  
- **Flagging System:** users can report ethical or factual issues.

### C. Privacy & Anonymity
- Default: anonymised publishing (“Learner #2941”).  
- Optional: show username or organisation if verified.  
- Reflection Cards shared publicly have identifiers removed.

---

## 🧩 3. Sharing Flow
```
User completes ILM or Pulse task → Shares prompt → AI Ethics Filter → Moderator Review → Publication → Community Interaction (Remix / Reflect / Comment)
```

### Example Workflow
1. **User Action:** clicks “Share Prompt.”  
2. **ASTRA Review:** runs a compliance check (no PII, bias, or violations).  
3. **Moderator Approval:** human verifies tone & integrity.  
4. **Publication:** prompt appears in Hall of Prompts with tags and credit.  
5. **Community Interaction:** others can bookmark, remix, or reflect on it.  
6. **Reward:** contributor earns *Community Insight* badge.

---

## 🧭 4. Tagging & Discovery
| Tag Type | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Framework** | CLEAR, RISEN, COAST, ILM, Hybrid |
| **Theme** | Security, Leadership, Ethics, Communication, Governance |
| **Skill** | Clarity, Creativity, Empathy, Strategy |
| **Level** | Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced |

## 🔧 7. Technical Design
### A. Schema (Conceptual)
```json
{
  "prompt_id": "uuid",
  "title": "AI Leadership Prompt – Empathy Lens",
  "framework": "ILM + Leadership",
  "tags": ["Leadership", "Empathy", "Clarity"],
  "content": "...",
  "author": {
    "display_name": "Learner #109",
    "verified": false
  },
  "created_at": "2025-11-01T17:00:00Z",
  "likes": 23,
  "remixes": 4,
  "status": "approved",
  "moderator_notes": "Great tone and governance clarity."
}
```

### B. Backend Logic
- Uses Supabase for storage & moderation queues.  
- Connects to AI Ethics Filter for pre-publication checks.  
- Integrates with Reflection Deck and Pulse for content resurfacing.

---

## 💬 8. Mentor Integration
- AstraCore can spotlight prompts directly in the Pulse Feed (“Inspired by the community”).  
- Provides reflection prompts like:  
  > “How might you remix this to suit your own awareness campaign?”  
- Recognises repeat contributors (“You’ve shared 3 Governance prompts — leadership through learning!”)

---

## 🔮 9. Future Expansion
1. **Organisation Mode** – Private ASTRA Communities for enterprises or training cohorts.  
2. **Collaborative Workshops** – Real-time prompt co-creation in ILM interface.  
3. **Mentor Roundtables** – Scheduled group reflections or expert Q&As.  
4. **AI-Driven Trend Reports** – Pulse analytics summarising emerging topics (“Empathy prompts trending 34% higher this quarter”).  
5. **Cross-Integration** – Export top prompts to SharePoint, Teams, or Slack.

---

## ✅ 10. Next Steps
1. Design Community Hub wireframes (Dashboard, Hall, Remix view).  
2. Define submission/moderation workflow.  
3. Prototype AI Ethics Filter (Gemini or GPT).  
4. Create badge logic and attribution engine.  
5. Prepare launch content (10 curated prompts + 5 reflections).
